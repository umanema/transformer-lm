Cardmusic for Audience
Ten performers carry large cards marked
with huge numerals, 1 through 10. They
stand on stage facing an audience. They
hold the cards so that when their arms
are down, the audience sees the blank
backs of the cards, and when they raise
their arms, the cards are above their
heads with numbers showing to the
audience.
The conductor asks every member of the
audience to pick one of the numbers
between 1 and 10 inclusive. He asks every
member of the audience to think of a
sound. He asks every member of the
audience to think of an action that can be
performed while standing up at their
seats.
It is explained that the piece is a simple,
binary (on-off) process: when a member
of the audience sees his chosen number
on stage, he stands, makes his noise, and
performs his action. This continues as
long as the number is visible. When the
number goes down again, he sits in his
place and makes no sound.
The conductor conducts the performers in
displaying their numbers, using different
timings, combinations, and sequences.
The audience performs the piece by
following the numbers in sounds and
actions.

at same time. 2. Each has different
recording or version of piece. All try to

member of the orchestra starts and stops
playing different sections of the recording
at will.

The cast is invited to conceive of a kind of
dance they will perform to the music after
only one hearing. No rehearsal takes
place.
At the time of the performance, a large
paper screen is stretched across the
stage or the front of the hall so that when
performers stand behind it, only their
calves and feet are visible. All the male
performers stand behind the screen.
A female performer is selected by some
arbitrary method. The female performer
selects her dance partner by choosing the
pair of feet that she likes best. The two
performers dance together to the music.

neck, and a bulky wool skirt; or, a bundle
of layered wool blankets; or, a specially
sewn sack with holes cut for the hands
and legs. The audience may not see the
performer and the performer may not see
the audience.
Walk out on stage or into the hall, moving
about slowly during the allocated time. At
the end of the time, two or three cast
members come out to guide the
performer off.
This may be performed as a solo, or it
may be performed by several or many

Theater
Act One
The stage represents a room, which once
was a hen-house, as can still be seen
from some equipment, hens, eggs, and
hen-shit. The room is furnished in heavy
Empire style. In one corner are a shitcovered plastic bust of Bismarck with one
mustache-tip broken off and a
tremendously dry, brown Christmas tree
in the other corner, decorated with one
colored glass ball and some cardboard
angels. Behind a sofa, an organ is vaguely
visible, incessantly attacked by a boy with
a healthy, even rubicund look. In the
middle of the floor, a big ice block is
slowly melting.
Act Two
Soft-boiled eggs and paper plates.
Act Three
Same as act one, but in the evening. The
whole stage seems to have turned slightly
to the left. Moonlight strains in through
branch-holes and key-holes. On the
Christmas tree a dying candle is dripping.

sofa cover, the broken-off mustache tip is
clumsily mended with blue modeling clay.

salute, but on stage nothing happens.

Quite often, you will hear the rattle of
trains that are passing over the railway

least three churches ringing. When these

2 Exhibitions
1 Ice
Some days after the break-up of the ice,
one can find large ice sheets floating in
the northern creeks of the lakes. Lifted up
in the air, these half-melted sheets will
often show an extraordinary beauty. There
are holes in most of them, which makes it
possible to hang them on dry sprucebranches.
Go up one morning and decorate the
forest with ice and let the opening start
soon after. There should be a number for
each piece of ice. The opening guests are
served sherry.
1965

2 Mold
The hot summer is the best season. At
various times one puts old pieces of bread
into a number of bread boxes in gay
colors. Let them stand with closed lids for
some time. Now and then one checks how

and beautiful phase, one makes an
exhibition. Have a number for each box.
Instead of sherry, serve vin rosé.

Streetcar Random
(music for any number of participants)
One used streetcar ticket is given to each
participant. On the cross-ruled ticket,
there are squares for day and hour, each
of which indicates one beat. The length of
the beats is decided by each participant,
who also determines how he wants to
read the ticket: horizontally or vertically,
to the right or to the left. It is expedient
that he keep to the chosen reading during
the whole performance. The uncut
squares indicate pauses, the squares
where the streetcar conductor has cut a
round hole indicates one beat of sound.
The source of the sound is optional. The
piece is over when the last participant has
become tired.
Suggested sources of sound: symphony
orchestra; car horns.

A Word Event for George Brecht
A man utters any word, preferably one
without expletive connotations. He then
proceeds to analyze it, 1st, into its
successive phonemes; 2nd, into a series
of phonemes representable by its
successive individual letters, whether or
not this series coincides with the 1st
series.
After repeating each of these series
alternately a few times, he begins to
permute the members of each series.
After uttering various permutations of
each series alternately several times, he
utters phonemes from both series in
random order, uttering them singly,
combining them into syllables, repeating
them &/or prolonging them ad libitum.
He ends the event by pronouncing one of
these phonemes very carefully.

fist, making faces, etc.) or sounds (tongue
clicks, pops, smacks, lip farts, etc.)
Performers may all perform same action
or different, or all perform same sound or

each can perform clearly – sharp, defined

with beat.
