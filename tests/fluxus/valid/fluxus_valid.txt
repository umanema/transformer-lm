Audience Variation No.1
The audience is all tied up together using
a long string. Performers in the aisles use
balls of string, throwing string over the
heads of the audience to opposite rows of
performers. Balls are thrown until all the
string is used up in creating a dense web
over the audience. Enough string must be
used to entangle the whole audience,
tying them to each other, to their chairs,
etc., making it difficult for them to leave.
After this has been achieved, the
performers leave the hall. The audience is
left to untangle itself.
